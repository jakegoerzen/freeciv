 MSYS2 Windows Installer build notes
====================================

This document is about building Freeciv Windows Installer packages
using MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/


 Status
====================================

- Buildable clients are gtk3.22, sdl2, and Qt5 for
  both win64 and win32 targets. For win64 target, one
  can build also Qt6-client.


 Setup
====================================

 This chapter is about creating new msys2 build environment.

 If you want to reproduce more official freeciv builds, the environment
 used to make those builds is documented in the next chapter ("Premade environment"),
 with listing of versions current at the time of this freeciv version.

1) Install MSYS2 following the documentation on their homepage

1.1) Download
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20220118.exe
 for win64 host

1.2) Run it to install MSYS2 on build system

1.3) Launch msys2_shell to update packages
> pacman -Syu

2) Install following packages with 'pacman -Su --needed'

2.1) Packages needed for building freeciv
 These packages are needed even if you don't plan to make installer,
 but only build freeciv for local use.

2.1.1) Arch independent packages needed for building freeciv

2.1.1.1) Arch independent packages always needed for building freeciv
 With these packages it's possible to build freeciv source tree that
 has already such generated files present that are created for the
 release tarball.

 - make
 - gettext

2.1.1.2) Arch independent packages needed for getting and extracting freeciv
 source tarball

 - tar

2.1.1.3) Arch independent packages needed for building freeciv from repository
 checkout. These are needed in addition to the ones always needed for building
 freeciv.

2.1.2.2) Arch-specific packages for building gtk3.22-client
 - mingw-w64-i686-gtk3 / mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3

2.1.2.3) Arch-specific packages for buildind Qt5-client and/or Qt5 Ruledit
 - mingw-w64-i686-qt5 / mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5

2.1.2.4) Arch-specific packages for building Qt6-client and/or Qt6 Ruledit
 - mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6-base

2.1.2.5) Arch-specific packages for building sdl2-client

 - mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_gfx / mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_gfx

2.2) Packages needed for building installer package
 These are needed in addition to above ones used in the
 building step already.

2.2.1) Arch-specific packages needed for building installer
 package

 - mingw-w64-i686-nsis / mingw-w64-x86_64-nsis


 Premade environment
====================================

Premade msys2 environment is available for download from
http://files.freeciv.org/packages/windows/msys2/

Current version is

win64 host:
-----------
msys2-freeciv-win64-220309.7z, based on
https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86-64/msys2-x86_64-20220118.exe
with packages updated to 09-Mar-2022 level.

Most packages are included for both win32 and win64 targets. For each package
listed below with <arch> in the name, actually two packages are installed;
one with a name where <arch> is replaced by 'i686' and
one where <arch> is replaced by 'x86_64'


Following packages have been installed:
- make
- tar
- git
- patch
- automake1.16
- libtool
- autoconf
- gdb
- mingw-w64-<arch>-gcc
- mingw-w64-<arch>-pkgconf
- mingw-w64-<arch>-icu
- mingw-w64-<arch>-curl
- mingw-w64-<arch>-sqlite3
- mingw-w64-<arch>-gtk3
- mingw-w64-<arch>-gtk4
- mingw-w64-<arch>-nsis
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_mixer
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_image
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_ttf
- mingw-w64-<arch>-SDL2_gfx
- mingw-w64-<arch>-imagemagick
- mingw-w64-<arch>-qt5
- mingw-w64-<arch>-drmingw
- mingw-w64-<arch>-meson
- mingw-w64-<arch>-tolua
- minww-w64-x86_64-qt6-base

After all the packages were installed 'pacman -Scc' was run to completely
empty the package cache for having smaller environment package.


 Build
====================================

Launch build target specific msys2 shell, either mingw64.exe or mingw32.exe.
Get the freeciv sources there somehow. Some options are:
1) Download freeciv tarball within msys2 shell with wget
2) Use git within msys2 shell to get them from version control
3) Copy them from Windows folder where they are to a directory that
   is within msys2

> cd windows/installer_msys2
> make <targets>

  Target can be:
  - "all" (default), build all installers
  - "<gui>-installer", where <gui> is
     - gtk3.22
     - sdl2
     - qt5
     - qt6
  - "ruledit-installer"
  - "snapshot", if your freeciv sources are in git checkout directory,
                builds all installers with commit id in version number

 You can also set minimum Windows version targeted. While setting this
 to an older version allows those Windows versions to run the created
 executables, it may come with the cost of disabling functionality that
 newer Windows versions could otherwise have.
 The version is set via MIN_WIN_VER variable. For values to use, see
 list in: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sehtctf.aspx
 Current default is 0x0601 (Windows 7).

 It's possible to set number of make jobs used in the build by
 setting suitable make parameter to MAKE_PARAMS environment variable, e,g,
 MAKE_PARAMS="-j3". The default is job count equal to number of
 processor cores in the system.


 Problems
====================================

- Freeciv linked against readline in msys2 does not work.
  Configure freeciv with --without-readline


 TODO
====================================

- Readline support
